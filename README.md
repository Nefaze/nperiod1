      <h1>Youtube</h1>
  <p>One of my favorite websites is youtube. i enjoy youtube because it has a vast variety of entertainment for anyone. most of my time i find myself watching true crime Documentaries or those confession room videos. I watch youtube more so for the disturbing content but i also occasionally like to watch those animated stories that be on tiktok with subway surfers at the bottom. youtube is much better in my opinion since it does not promote brain rot or add to whats causing us to day by day go further into being unable to focus for more than 30 seconds.

  <h1>new grounds</h1>
  <p>zaire introduced me to newgrounds 2 years ago while we were heading hom on the bus.its an platform where you can support artist, upload art and play fun free games online. i dont use this site as much as i used to back in the day but i enjoyed looking at the different fan art of my favorite characters. while also being able to play free rpg like games with good quality visual and gameplay.</p>

  <h1>solitare</h1>
  <p>I feel like a corporate worker some times but i do enjoy a good game of solitare. its a bit difficult though since you have to make sure every move is calculated or it may just ruin you in the long run. Its probably the only games i have on my phone besides minecraft and tetris. i like games like this so i tried spider and it was very different maybe even worse, since if im not mistaken instead of one card being drawn a card gets drawn for each pile. therefore any planning you did previously needs to be unlocked again by moving the cards on top. </p>
